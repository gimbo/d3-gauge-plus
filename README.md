# `d3-gauge-plus.js` - Advanced guages in d3

This is a fork of Tomer Doron's [gauge.js](https://gist.github.com/tomerd/1499279) implementation of "[google style gauge's using d3.js](http://tomerdoron.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/google-style-gauges-using-d3js.html)".  It adds lots more configuration options, including the ability to rotate the gauge and change the size of the gap.

[Live demo here](http://gimbo.github.io/d3-gauge-plus/demo/).
